## Day 3 Homework

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a promote/fave button, just like you did yesterday!
* Add a delete button, just like yesterday!

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Add buttons to move a flick up and down the list

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting part 2

* Persist the flicks data using window.localstorage. The flicks should stay in the list even when the page is refreshed.

##  Day 4 Homework

### Base Requirement

* Fix the issue with flick id values, which sometimes results in removing the wrong flick from the array (and thus from local storage).

### Bonus Credit

* Also track the year the flick was realeased
* Make it look nice (CSS!)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Edit the names of flicks that are already in the list (and make sure the changes persist across page loads).  Gee, it would be nice if we could make that span's _content editable_ somehow...

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Have a good weekend!
